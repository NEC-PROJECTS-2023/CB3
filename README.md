### Introduction 
Air travel has become a common mode of transportation for people all over 
the world, but the cost of flights can vary greatly depending on a variety of factors. One way 
to make air travel more affordable is to find the best deal on flight fares. Predicting flight 
fares accurately can be a complex task as it involves considering multiple variables that affect the pricing. In this context, the Random Forest algorithm has proven to be a powerful 
and effective tool for predicting flight fares. In the case of flight fare prediction, the metrics 
such as source, destination, number of stops, airline company, arrival time, and departure 
time are taken into consideration. These factors can significantly affect the price of a flight 
ticket. By utilizing these metrics, the random forest algorithm can make highly accurate predictions of flight fares, which can help travelers make informed decisions about their travel 
plans. In this article, we will explore the use of the Random Forest algorithm for predicting 
flight fares based on these important metrics. We will provide an overview of the algorithm, 
explain how it works, and demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting flight fares. Random 
Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that is used for both classification and regression tasks. It is an ensemble learning method that combines the output of multiple decision 
trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions.
